One morning I was standing in a queue in my local bakery, and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a woman buying one of those small quasi-pizzas. Pizzas ~20cm in diameter. Immediately I thought about how profitable it is when compared to the full-size 42cm pizza. Since the area of a larger pizza is 4 times bigger, of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not worth buying smaller pizzas.
Then I thought about fitting smaller pizzas inside the bigger one.</description></item><item><title>Comparing fractions of fractions on COVID case üò∑</title><link>/posts/comparing-fractions-of-fractions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:38:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/comparing-fractions-of-fractions/</guid><description>
I had a little argue recently with one anti-vaxxer and I thought it will make an interesting blog content. I tried to convince them that vaccinating is good because people are at least not dieing and what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard was:
Ohh, vaccines are not helping at all. A friend of mine is working at the hospital at says that 50% of covid patients were already vaccinated.
I decided not to argue nor check the data source, but rather give it a try.</description></item></channel></rss>
