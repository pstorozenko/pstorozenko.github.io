&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s always nice if you can use your technical skills for something &lt;em>good&lt;/em> for our planet.
I have this opportunity during work at Appsilon where from time to time we work on &lt;a href="/tags/data4good/" title="Data4Good projects">Data4Good projects&lt;/a>.
One such project was &lt;a href="posts/copepods-blogpost.md">copepods/plankton project&lt;/a> where I was doing segmentation of the oil sac in the Arctic plankton.
This time I&amp;rsquo;d like to share something from the other pole of the globe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently we work on detecting the Antarctic shags nests on the Antarctic islands.
Together with Jędrzej Świeżewski and Joanna Kaleta we were cooperating with researchers from &lt;a href="https://ibb.edu.pl/en/laboratory/robert-bialik/">IBB PAS&lt;/a> on this task.

&lt;p>Some time ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on an oil sac (energy reservoir) detection in copepods (kind of zooplankton) for Université Laval.
&lt;a href="/posts/ml4plankton-conference/">Apart from presenting the results on the ML4Plankton conference&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ve published a detailed blog post on &lt;a href="https://appsilon.com/monitoring-marine-ecosystems-with-machine-learning/">the Appsilon blog&lt;/a> that I strongly encourage you to read!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Presentation at ML4Plankton Conference 🌊🐟</title><link>/posts/ml4plankton-conference/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 09:50:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/ml4plankton-conference/</guid><description>
Recently I was working at work on detecting the oil sac in copepods. This is was a super cool problem in which we received data from professor Frédéric Maps from Université Laval. We together gave a talk on conference ML4Plankton that you can watch online! First Frederic gives some context on why this problem is important and later I explain methods used and problems you can find. Our talk is available online here:</description></item></channel></rss>
