Recently I was working at work on detecting the oil sac in copepods. This is was a super cool problem in which we received data from professor Fr√©d√©ric Maps from Universit√© Laval. We together gave a talk on conference ML4Plankton that you can watch online! First Frederic gives some context on why this problem is important and later I explain methods used and problems you can find. Our talk is available online here:</description></item></channel></rss>
