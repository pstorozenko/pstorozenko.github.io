&lt;p>Some time ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on an oil sac (energy reservoir) detection in copepods (kind of zooplankton) for Université Laval.
&lt;a href="/posts/ml4plankton-conference/">Apart from presenting the results on the ML4Plankton conference&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ve published a detailed blog post on &lt;a href="https://appsilon.com/monitoring-marine-ecosystems-with-machine-learning/">the Appsilon blog&lt;/a> that I strongly encourage you to read!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Presentation at ML4Plankton Conference 🌊🐟</title><link>/posts/ml4plankton-conference/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 09:50:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/ml4plankton-conference/</guid><description>
Recently I was working at work on detecting the oil sac in copepods. This is was a super cool problem in which we received data from professor Frédéric Maps from Université Laval. We together gave a talk on conference ML4Plankton that you can watch online! First Frederic gives some context on why this problem is important and later I explain methods used and problems you can find. Our talk is available online here:</description></item></channel></rss>
