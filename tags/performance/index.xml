&lt;p>In a recent post, I presented how memory layout may influence a matrix summing speed.
It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see that there are plenty of pitfalls we might fall into when writing sum function and memory layout is not the only one.
Please first &lt;a href="/posts/speed-of-traversing-matrix/" title="Post on summing by rows vs cols first">read the previous post on summing&lt;/a> if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without thinking &lt;em>why&lt;/em>, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at those two functions:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speed of Traversing Matrix → vs ↓</title><link>/posts/speed-of-traversing-matrix/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 22:24:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/speed-of-traversing-matrix/</guid><description>
Today I would like to mention a low-level peculiarity I was taught in highschool, but passed over during my studies.
Why it differs whetter matrix is traversed by rows or columns? # Even though we think of a matrices as a two dimensional creatures, inside a computer they have to be stored as a sequence of numbers. Therefore there are two schemas one can follow, row-first and column-first. Historically they are called C-style and Fortran-style respectively.</description></item></channel></rss>
