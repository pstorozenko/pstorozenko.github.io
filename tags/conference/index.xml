&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sfinks.fizyka.pw.edu.pl/">SFINKS&lt;/a> is a small conference on complex systems and interdisciplinary physics.
I wanted to present something there since the first edition in 2016, but I never stood a chance.
Every year there was something up, like an international exchange or a lot of tough exams.
Finally, this year I was able to fullfil my dream as I presented a lightning talk &lt;em>O strachu przed liczeniem na papierze&lt;/em> (eng. &lt;em>About the fear of calculating on paper&lt;/em>).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Presentation at ML4Plankton Conference 🌊🐟</title><link>/posts/ml4plankton-conference/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 09:50:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/ml4plankton-conference/</guid><description>
Recently I was working at work on detecting the oil sac in copepods. This is was a super cool problem in which we received data from professor Frédéric Maps from Université Laval. We together gave a talk on conference ML4Plankton that you can watch online! First Frederic gives some context on why this problem is important and later I explain methods used and problems you can find. Our talk is available online here:</description></item><item><title>StyleGANv2 in Your Hands 💇👻</title><link>/posts/stylegan-in-your-hands/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 22:30:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/stylegan-in-your-hands/</guid><description>
This is the second post from micro-series preceding the SFI conference. In the first post I showed how easy it is to do the style transfer at home. Now, I would like to present you how to play with StyleGANv2. StyleGANv2 is the second version of StyleGAN, they are very similar in core principals. We will be working with StyleGANv2 but I will refer to it as SG. There is a lot that can be said/explained about SG.</description></item><item><title>Playing With Style Transfer 🎨</title><link>/posts/playing-with-style-transfer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 21:12:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/playing-with-style-transfer/</guid><description>
As mentioned earlier, I will be giving a talk on the 17th SFI IT Academic Festival on the topic of style transfer and StyleGAN. In this post I would like to show you how easy it is to play with style transfer on your own!
To tutorial or not to tutorial # It might be obvious for you to check Tensorflow/PyTorch tutorials if you wanted to learn how to create style-transfer system.</description></item><item><title>SFI Conference 👨‍🏫🎉</title><link>/posts/sfi-conference/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 14:55:23 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/sfi-conference/</guid><description>
I am happy to share that I was invited (for the first time in my life!) to give a talk on a conference. 🎉 It will be the 17th SFI IT Academic Festival, organized by students from the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. The conference will be held on 14-16 of March 2022.
My lecture will be in Polish on topic StyleGAN w Twoich rękach -&amp;gt; StyleGAN in Your Hands, I will talk about transfer learning in general and later about StyleGANv2.</description></item></channel></rss>
