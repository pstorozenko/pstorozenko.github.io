This is the second post from micro-series preceding the SFI conference. In the first post I showed how easy it is to do the style transfer at home. Now, I would like to present you how to play with StyleGANv2. StyleGANv2 is the second version of StyleGAN, they are very similar in core principals. We will be working with StyleGANv2 but I will refer to it as SG. There is a lot that can be said/explained about SG.</description></item><item><title>Playing With Style Transfer 🎨</title><link>/posts/playing-with-style-transfer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 21:12:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/playing-with-style-transfer/</guid><description>
As mentioned earlier, I will be giving a talk on the 17th SFI IT Academic Festival on the topic of style transfer and StyleGAN. In this post I would like to show how easy it is to play with style transfer on your own!
To tutorial or not to tutorial It might be obvious for you to check Tensorflow/PyTorch tutorials if you wanted to learn how to create style-transfer system. But what if you do not want to learn anything?</description></item><item><title>SFI Conference 👨‍🏫🎉</title><link>/posts/sfi-conference/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 14:55:23 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/sfi-conference/</guid><description>
I am happy to share that I was invited (for the first time in my life!) to give a talk on a conference. 🎉 It will be the 17th SFI IT Academic Festival, organized by students from the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. The conference will be held on 14-16 of March 2022.
My lecture will be in Polish on topic StyleGAN w Twoich rękach -&amp;gt; StyleGAN in Your Hands, I will talk about transfer learning in general and later about StyleGANv2.</description></item></channel></rss>
