In the post about fitting pizzas inside another pizza I&amp;rsquo;ve shown the following picture and promised a post about recreating it.
Pizzas packed in pizza However, I would not like to assume that everyone is familiar with the optimization theory (you may graduate from Computer Science and still not know a lot) so I want to present an introduction here as high school math and quadratic equations are enough to understand those concepts.</description></item><item><title>How to Sum Like a Boss (Almost) Œ£</title><link>/posts/how-to-sum-like-a-boss/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 08:42:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/how-to-sum-like-a-boss/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In a recent post, I presented how memory layout may influence a matrix summing speed.
It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see that there are plenty of pitfalls we might fall into when writing sum function and memory layout is not the only one.
Please first &lt;a href="/posts/speed-of-traversing-matrix/" title="Post on summing by rows vs cols first">read the previous post on summing&lt;/a> if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without thinking &lt;em>why&lt;/em>, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at those two functions:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speed of Traversing Matrix ‚Üí vs ‚Üì</title><link>/posts/speed-of-traversing-matrix/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 22:24:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/speed-of-traversing-matrix/</guid><description>
Today I would like to mention a low-level peculiarity I was taught in highschool, but passed over during my studies.
Why it differs whetter matrix is traversed by rows or columns? Even though we think of a matrices as a two dimensional creatures, inside a computer they have to be stored as a sequence of numbers. Therefore there are two schemas one can follow, row-first and column-first. Historically they are called C-style and Fortran-style respectively.</description></item><item><title>Pizza Twice as Big üçï</title><link>/posts/pizza-twice-as-big/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 11:01:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/pizza-twice-as-big/</guid><description>
One morning I was standing in a queue in my local bakery, and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a woman buying one of those small quasi-pizzas. Pizzas ~20cm in diameter. Immediately I thought about how profitable it is when compared to the full-size 42cm pizza. Since the area of a larger pizza is 4 times bigger, of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not worth buying smaller pizzas.
Then I thought about fitting smaller pizzas inside the bigger one.</description></item></channel></rss>
