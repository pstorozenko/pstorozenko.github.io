&lt;p>In &lt;a href="/posts/mathematical-optimization/">the previous post&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ve presented the basics of stating mathematical optimization problems and JuMP framework in julia.
Today let&amp;rsquo;s follow up with concrete examples!
Please checkout &lt;a href="https://github.com/pstorozenko/pstorozenko.github.io/blob/main/code/practical-mathematical-optimization/main.ipynb">the accompanying jupyter notebook&lt;/a> even though you might not feel like a programmer.
It&amp;rsquo;s very clear and shows how easy it is to obtain solutions!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction Into Mathematical Optimization Way of Thinking üßÆ</title><link>/posts/mathematical-optimization/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 19:40:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/mathematical-optimization/</guid><description>
In the post about fitting pizzas inside another pizza I&amp;rsquo;ve shown the following picture and promised a post about recreating it.
Pizzas packed in pizza However, I would not like to assume that everyone is familiar with the optimization theory (you may graduate from Computer Science and still not know a lot) so I want to present an introduction here as high school math and quadratic equations are enough to understand those concepts.</description></item><item><title>The Leuven Ring Problem ‚óã</title><link>/posts/leuven-ring-problem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 01:33:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/leuven-ring-problem/</guid><description>
During my studies, I spent one semester at KU Leuven. There is one interesting mathematical problem from those times I&amp;rsquo;d like to share. This Belgian city has a topology of a big circle with a city inside.
One early, cold, damp, and windy morning (as it is in Belgium) when I was coming back from some trip I had to go from the railway station (right side of the ring) to my dormitory (bottom of the ring).</description></item><item><title>Pizza Twice as Big üçï</title><link>/posts/pizza-twice-as-big/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 11:01:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/pizza-twice-as-big/</guid><description>
One morning I was standing in a queue in my local bakery, and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a woman buying one of those small quasi-pizzas. Pizzas ~20cm in diameter. Immediately I thought about how profitable it is when compared to the full-size 42cm pizza. Since the area of a larger pizza is 4 times bigger, of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not worth buying smaller pizzas.
Then I thought about fitting smaller pizzas inside the bigger one.</description></item><item><title>Comparing fractions of fractions on COVID case üò∑</title><link>/posts/comparing-fractions-of-fractions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:38:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/comparing-fractions-of-fractions/</guid><description>
I had a little argue recently with one anti-vaxxer and I thought it will make an interesting blog content. I tried to convince them that vaccinating is good because people are at least not dieing and what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard was:
Ohh, vaccines are not helping at all. A friend of mine is working at the hospital at says that 50% of covid patients were already vaccinated.
I decided not to argue nor check the data source, but rather give it a try.</description></item></channel></rss>
