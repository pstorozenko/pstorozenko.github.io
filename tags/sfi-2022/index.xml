      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second post from micro-series preceding the SFI conference.
In &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/playing-with-style-transfer/&#34;&gt;the first post&lt;/a&gt; I showed how easy it is to do the style transfer at home.
Now, I would like to present you how to play with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2&#34;&gt;StyleGANv2&lt;/a&gt;.
StyleGANv2 is &lt;a href=&#34;https://indipest.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/bw6d5zz.gif&#34;&gt;the second version of StyleGAN&lt;/a&gt;, they are very similar in core principals.
We will be working with StyleGANv2 but I will refer to it as SG.
There is a lot that can be said/explained about SG.
Here I would like to focus on showing how to make your own experiments with SG instead of getting into SG&amp;rsquo;s details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/posts/sfi-conference/&#34;&gt;As mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, I will be giving a talk on &lt;a href=&#34;https://sfi.pl/en/&#34;&gt;the 17th SFI IT Academic Festival&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of style transfer and StyleGAN.
In this post I would like to show you how easy it is to play with style transfer on your own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-tutorial-or-not-to-tutorial&#34;&gt;To tutorial or not to tutorial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be obvious for you to check Tensorflow/PyTorch tutorials if you wanted to learn how to create style-transfer system.
But what if you do not want to learn anything?
Maybe all you want is just to do the style transfer on your photos?
Apparently tutorials with colab notebooks are all you need!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am happy to share that I was invited (for the first time in my life!) to give a talk on a conference. üéâ
It will be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sfi.pl/en/&#34;&gt;17th SFI IT Academic Festival&lt;/a&gt;, organized by students from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start&#34;&gt;Jagiellonian University&lt;/a&gt; in Cracow.
The conference will be held on 14-16 of March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My lecture will be in Polish on topic &lt;em&gt;StyleGAN w Twoich rƒôkach&lt;/em&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;StyleGAN in Your Hands&lt;/em&gt;, I will talk about transfer learning in general and later about &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2&#34;&gt;StyleGANv2&lt;/a&gt;.
The exact time and place will posted on SFI webpage.
You can expect some materials regarding the talk later on my blog!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
