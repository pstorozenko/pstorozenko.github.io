Today I have a short one, a follow-up to the post on pizza sizes. Recently, I was in my local pizza place where I had to choose between 32 and 46cm pizza. The bigger one cost 5 PLN more. Even without looking at my table, I chose the bigger one.

Immediately I thought about how profitable it is when compared to the full-size 42cm pizza.

Then I thought about fitting smaller pizzas inside the bigger one.</description></item></channel></rss>
