      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to switch the theme of the blog.
This was unexpected and was a hard reminder that you should always be careful with your dependencies.
You may rarely think about a theme being a dependency, but when I wanted to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend&#34;&gt;hello-friend&lt;/a&gt; theme under hugo 0.145.x, I discovered its no longer maintained (for over 3 years), the generation just failed.
There were some deprecations, but they already became errors in the hugo version I was using.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
