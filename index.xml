&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m writing a series of posts on detecting solar panels from satellite images at my company, &lt;a href="https://appsilon.com">Appsilon&lt;/a>.
To be honest, not from satellite images but from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthophoto">orthophotos&lt;/a>.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what are orthophotos, the good news is that &lt;a href="https://appsilon.com/using-ai-to-detect-solar-panels-part-1/">the first post has been released recently!&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Sum Like a Boss (Almost) Œ£</title><link>/posts/how-to-sum-like-a-boss/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 08:42:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/how-to-sum-like-a-boss/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In a recent post, I presented how memory layout may influence a matrix summing speed.
It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see that there are plenty of pitfalls we might fall into when writing sum function and memory layout is not the only one.
Please first &lt;a href="/posts/speed-of-traversing-matrix/" title="Post on summing by rows vs cols first">read the previous post on summing&lt;/a> if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without thinking &lt;em>why&lt;/em>, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at those two functions:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ML Data Versioning With DVC: How to manage machine learning data üóÉ</title><link>/posts/ml-data-versioning-with-dvc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 07:23:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/ml-data-versioning-with-dvc/</guid><description>
Recently I wrote a post about DVC at my company&amp;rsquo;s, Appsilon blog. DVC is like a git, but for data, models and experiments. It also allows for creating an automated experiments pipelines.
As a teaser I&amp;rsquo;ll just say that, having prepared scripts for model training and evaluating, when new data is added to the repo, the whole training is run automatically. Metrics are saved to appropriate files alongside with parameters, same with plots.</description></item><item><title>Speed of Traversing Matrix ‚Üí vs ‚Üì</title><link>/posts/speed-of-traversing-matrix/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 22:24:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/speed-of-traversing-matrix/</guid><description>
Today I would like to mention a low-level peculiarity I was taught in highschool, but passed over during my studies.
Why it differs whetter matrix is traversed by rows or columns? Even though we think of a matrices as a two dimensional creatures, inside a computer they have to be stored as a sequence of numbers. Therefore there are two schemas one can follow, row-first and column-first. Historically they are called C-style and Fortran-style respectively.</description></item><item><title>The Leuven Ring Problem ‚óã</title><link>/posts/leuven-ring-problem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 01:33:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/leuven-ring-problem/</guid><description>
During my studies, I spent one semester at KU Leuven. There is one interesting mathematical problem from those times I&amp;rsquo;d like to share. This Belgian city has a topology of a big circle with a city inside.
One early, cold, damp, and windy morning (as it is in Belgium) when I was coming back from some trip I had to go from the railway station (right side of the ring) to my dormitory (bottom of the ring).</description></item><item><title>Pizza Twice as Big üçï</title><link>/posts/pizza-twice-as-big/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 11:01:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/pizza-twice-as-big/</guid><description>
One morning I was standing in a queue in my local bakery, and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a woman buying one of those small quasi-pizzas. Pizzas ~20cm in diameter. Immediately I thought about how profitable it is when compared to the full-size 42cm pizza. Since the area of a larger pizza is 4 times bigger, of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not worth buying smaller pizzas.
Then I thought about fitting smaller pizzas inside the bigger one.</description></item><item><title>Comparing fractions of fractions on COVID case üò∑</title><link>/posts/comparing-fractions-of-fractions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:38:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/comparing-fractions-of-fractions/</guid><description>
I had a little argue recently with one anti-vaxxer and I thought it will make an interesting blog content. I tried to convince them that vaccinating is good because people are at least not dieing and what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard was:
Ohh, vaccines are not helping at all. A friend of mine is working at the hospital at says that 50% of covid patients were already vaccinated.
I decided not to argue nor check the data source, but rather give it a try.</description></item><item><title>My First Post!</title><link>/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 23:51:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>
Hello, my name is Pasza /Ààpa Éa/ and I welcome you to my blog. My plan is to share with you many insights I find on interesting topics. Some will be probably understandable for primary school kids and some will require university level math. This is however my blog and I can do what I want ^^.
You can find more about me in related pages. As for now you can check out useful materials.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>
Hi, my name is Piotr Pasza Storo≈ºenko located in Warsaw, Poland. I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist, physicist, by heart with love for programming. Wannabe applied mathematician. A huge julia enthusiast, but I code mostly in python and R. Some small chunks of code and simulations in C++17 and newer are also fine ^^. On this blog I share things I find interesting.

Here I present some resources I found very useful when learning various stuff:
Youtube channels I know that because of youtube I was able to see a lot of different experiment that I only heard about during my classes in high school. It kept my curiosity at high level and encouraged me to study physics. During my studies I understood various concepts only because of brilliant content creators from youtube. Here I pay my small tribute to some of my favorite scientific videos creators.</description></item></channel></rss>
