Here I present some resources I found very useful when learning various stuff:
Youtube channels I know that because of youtube I was able to see a lot of different experiment that I only heard about during my classes in high school. It kept my curiosity at high level and encouraged me to study physics. During my studies I understood various concepts only because of brilliant content creators from youtube. Here I pay my small tribute to some of my favorite scientific videos creators.</description></item></channel></rss>
