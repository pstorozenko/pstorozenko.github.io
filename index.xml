&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s always nice if you can use your technical skills for something &lt;em>good&lt;/em> for our planet.
I have this opportunity during work at Appsilon where from time to time we work on &lt;a href="/tags/data4good/" title="Data4Good projects">Data4Good projects&lt;/a>.
One such project was &lt;a href="/posts/copepods-blogpost/">copepods/plankton project&lt;/a> where I was doing segmentation of the oil sac in the Arctic plankton.
This time I&amp;rsquo;d like to share something from the other pole of the globe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently we work on detecting the Antarctic shags nests on the Antarctic islands.
Together with Jędrzej Świeżewski and Joanna Kaleta we were cooperating with researchers from &lt;a href="https://ibb.edu.pl/en/laboratory/robert-bialik/">IBB PAS&lt;/a> on this task.

&lt;p>What if you just don&amp;rsquo;t like &lt;code>rmd&lt;/code>/&lt;code>qmd&lt;/code> format anymore?
You love jupyter notebooks and that&amp;rsquo;s your way of working (that&amp;rsquo;s me).
Still, you must generate report from time to time.
Fortunately &lt;code>quarto&lt;/code> solves this problem brilliantly!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reports look beautifully.
Not only htmls what we might expect, but pdfs as well!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One thing is to train the model, but another is to serve it.
In between those two phases, model serialization and deserialization occurs.
In simpler words it&amp;rsquo;s just model saving and loading.
It&amp;rsquo;s important because different methods result in different:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Inference speed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Model size&lt;/li>

When working with deep learning problems I usually use PyTorch. I like this framework as it gives me a lot of freedom and allows to write code in the pythonic way. Using bare pytorch unfortunately often means writing a lot of boilerplate code, which no-one like. Another problem that arises during longer and larger projects is experiments running and configuration maintenance. I tackle those two problems by using pytorch-lightning and Hydra.</description></item><item><title>DaftAcademy Announcement 🐍👨‍🏫</title><link>/posts/daftacademy-announcement/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2022 23:32:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/daftacademy-announcement/</guid><description>

Why it differs whetter matrix is traversed by rows or columns? # Even though we think of a matrices as a two dimensional creatures, inside a computer they have to be stored as a sequence of numbers.

One morning I was standing in a queue in my local bakery, and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a woman buying one of those small quasi-pizzas. Pizzas ~20cm in diameter. Immediately I thought about how profitable it is when compared to the full-size 42cm pizza. Since the area of a larger pizza is 4 times bigger, of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not worth buying smaller pizzas.

I had a little argue recently with one anti-vaxxer and I thought it will make an interesting blog content. I tried to convince them that vaccinating is good because people are at least not dieing and what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard was:
Ohh, vaccines are not helping at all. A friend of mine is working at the hospital at says that 50% of covid patients were already vaccinated.
I decided not to argue nor check the data source, but rather give it a try.</description></item><item><title>My First Post!</title><link>/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 23:51:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>
Hello, my name is Pasza /ˈpaʃa/ and I welcome you to my blog. My plan is to share with you many insights I find on interesting topics. Some will be probably understandable for primary school kids and some will require university level math. This is however my blog and I can do what I want ^^.
You can find more about me in related pages. As for now you can check out useful materials.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>
Hi, my name is Piotr Pasza Storożenko located in Warsaw, Poland. I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist, physicist, by heart with love for programming. Wannabe applied mathematician. A huge julia enthusiast, but I code mostly in python and R. I prefer PyTorch⚡ to TensorFlow. :) Some small chunks of code and simulations in C++17 and newer are also fine ^^. On this blog I share things I find interesting.

Here I present some resources I found very useful when learning various stuff:
Youtube channels # I know that because of youtube I was able to see a lot of different experiment that I only heard about during my classes in high school. It kept my curiosity at high level and encouraged me to study physics. During my studies I understood various concepts only because of brilliant content creators from youtube.</description></item></channel></rss>
