Hello, my name is Pasza /ˈpɑʃɑ/ and I welcome you to my blog.
My plan is to share with you all insights I find on interesting topics.
Some will be probably understandable for primary school kids and some will require university level math.
This is however my blog and I can do what I want ^^.

You can find more about me in related pages.
As for now you can check out [useful materials]({{< ref "useful-materials" >}}).
I will try to tag content with appropriate categories to make it easier to browse.

See you next post!
