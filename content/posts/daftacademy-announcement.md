I'm happy to announce that I'll create and teach the course [_Python LevelUP: Data Science by Appsilon_](https://www.daftacademy.pl/python-levelup-data-sciene-by-appsilon) in collaboration with [DaftAcademy](https://www.daftacademy.pl/), part of [DaftCode](https://daftcode.pl/).

This will be a five-week course on the basics of Data Science in python.
**The course materials will be available on GitHub for free**.
Apart from teaching the classic stuff, I'll try to show some of the newest and coolest libraries out there.
Even if you already know most of this stuff, I really recommend to take a closer look on the unknown packages.

Course plan:
1. Introduction and working with numbers - `numpy` but also `numba`
2. Working with dataftames - `pandas` but also `polars`
3. Plotting - `matplotlib` but also `plotly.express`
4. Introduction to machine learning - `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`
5. Reporting - `streamlit`, `quarto`, `fastapi`

All the information can be found on [the DaftAcademy webpage](https://www.daftacademy.pl/python-levelup-data-sciene-by-appsilon).
