[SFINKS](http://sfinks.fizyka.pw.edu.pl/) is a small conference on complex systems and interdisciplinary physics. 
I wanted to present something there since the first edition in 2016, but I never stood a chance.
Every year there was something up, like an international exchange or a lot of tough exams.
Finally, this year I was able to fullfil my dream as I presented a lightning talk _O strachu przed liczeniem na papierze_ (eng. _About the fear of calculating on paper_).
<!--more-->
The talk is a short speed-run of the last part of my master thesis in which I :

1. Analyzed over 270 GB of tweets and looked for hashtags popularity time series.
2. Created and simulated an agent-based model that aimed at reproducing twitter dynamics.
3. **Simplified and solved the approximated model analytically on paper.**

[The slides (in Polish) are available online.](/posts/sfinks-2022/sfinks_2022.pdf)

I was awarded the 3rd place for a talk in the category of PhD students (although I'm not perusing a PhD degree, but I don't study either :p).
