I am happy to share that I was invited (for the first time in my life!) to give a talk on a conference. 🎉
It will be the [17th SFI IT Academic Festival](https://sfi.pl/en/), organized by students from the [Jagiellonian University](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start) in Cracow.
The conference will be held on 14-16 of March 2022.

My lecture will be in Polish on topic _StyleGAN w Twoich rękach_ -> _StyleGAN in Your Hands_, I will talk about transfer learning in general and later about [StyleGANv2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2).
The exact time and place will posted on SFI webpage. 
You can expect some materials regarding the talk later on my blog!
