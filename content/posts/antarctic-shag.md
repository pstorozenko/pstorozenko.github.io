It's always nice if you can use your technical skills for something _good_ for our planet.
I have this opportunity during work at Appsilon where from time to time we work on [Data4Good projects]({{< ref "/tags/data4good" >}} "Data4Good projects").
One such project was [copepods/plankton project](posts/copepods-blogpost.md) where I was doing segmentation of the oil sac in the Arctic plankton.
This time I'd like to share something from the other pole of the globe.

Currently we work on detecting the Antarctic shags nests on the Antarctic islands.
Together with Jędrzej Świeżewski and Joanna Kaleta we were cooperating with researchers from [IBB PAS](https://ibb.edu.pl/en/laboratory/robert-bialik/) on this task.
