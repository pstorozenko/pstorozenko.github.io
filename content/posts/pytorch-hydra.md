When working with deep learning problems I usually use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
I like this framework as it gives me a lot of freedom and allows to write code in [the pythonic way](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/).
Using bare pytorch unfortunately often means writing a lot of [boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code), which no-one like.
Another problem that arises during longer and larger projects is experiments running and configuration maintenance.
I tackle those two problems by using [`pytorch-lightning`](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) and [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/).
Recently I described my approach in [a post on the Appsilon blog](https://appsilon.com/pytorch-lightning-hydra-templates-in-machine-learning/).
