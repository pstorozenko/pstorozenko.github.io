In the post about fitting pizzas inside another pizza I've shown the following picture and promised a post about recreating it.

{{< figure src="/posts/pizza-twice-as-big/circles_in_circle.png" style="width:50%; margin: auto;" title="pizzas in pizza" caption="Pizzas packed in pizza">}}

However, I would not like to assume that everyone is familiar with the [optimization theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) (you may graduate from Computer Science and still not know a lot) so I want to present an introduction here as high school math and quadratic equations are enough to understand those concepts.

## Mathematical optimization for dummies

Mathematical optimization is usually just asking a question about finding values of some **variables** that **minimize** or **maximize** value of some function.
We call this function the **objective**.
For example:

$$
\min _x x^2 - 4x + 2.
$$

With usage of high-school formula we can write:

$$
\min _x x^2 - 4x + 2 = \min _x \ (x - 2)^2,
$$

and find $x_{\text{min}} = 2$.

### Constrains in mathematical optimization

Often our optimization problem is **constrained** somehow.
In the language of mathematical optimization we say that some variable is **subjected to**.
We can introduce two types of constrains:

1. Inequality constraint e.g. $x \le 4$
2. Equality constraint e.g. $y = x - 5$

For example:

$$
\min_x x^2 + 5 \newline
\text{s.t.} \\, 4 \le x \le 10
$$

and here solution is $x_{min} = 4$ and objective function is $4^2 + 5 = 21$.
Note that the interval is closed.
It is super rare for optimization problems to have open boundaries.
Try to think what it would mean.

Let's consider:

$$
\max_{x, y} 4y \newline
\text{s.t.} \\, x \le 3 \newline
\quad x = 2y + 2
$$

It may not be as obvious at first but $x_{max} = 3$, $y_{max} = 0.5$ with objective equal to $2$.
What is interesting here is that we maximize over variables $x$ and $y$, while $x$ is not explicitly present in our objective function.
Of course we may rewrite the problem by substituting $y$ by $x$.
$$
2y = x - 2 \newline
y = (x - 2) / 2 \newline
$$

$$
4y = 2(x-2) = 2x - 4
$$

$$
\max_{x} 2x - 4 \newline
\text{s.t.} \\, x \le 3 \newline
\quad y = (x - 2) / 2
$$

Problem written like this is much easier to solve by hand, and we eliminated one variable.

## Solving optimization problems using julia

Let's try to phrase above problems using `julia`.
We will be using `JuMP` package as it has a convenient interface.
The code is so self-explaining that I leave it as is.
At GitHub you will find a jupyter notebook with this code.

This is the first simple quadratic problem:

```julia
model = Model(Ipopt.Optimizer)

@variable(model, x)

@objective(model, Min, x^2 + 5 )
@constraint(model, 4 <= x <= 10)

optimize!(model)
```

To get the value of variable $x$ and objective function:
```julia
julia> value(x), objective_value(model)
(3.0000000297721905, 35.00000032749409)
```

And the second problem with two variables:

```julia
model = Model(Ipopt.Optimizer)

@variable(model, x)
@variable(model, y)

@objective(model, Max, 4y)
@constraint(model, x <= 3)
@constraint(model, x == 2y + 2)

optimize!(model)
```

```julia
julia> value(x), value(y), objective_value(model)
(3.000000028747048, 0.500000014373524, 2.000000057494096)
```

## The two paths in mathematical optimization

What I haven't said yet is that there are two main paths in optimization field:

1. Writing problems in framework presented above.
2. Writing solvers for those problems.

Those problems are surprisingly separable.
You may have strong skills in formulating optimization problems and doesn't have any clue about low-level processor optimization.
Similarly you may love to find all the weird SIMD optimization and be careful about memory patters and doesn't really care _what_ are you calculating.

## Why this post was interesting?

While problems described above may not be so fascinating, they serve as good examples how to write problems in mathematical optimization framework.
Stay tuned for the next mathematical optimization post in which we will solve some imaginary real-life problems using `JuMP`!!!
