This one is short. :)

Usually when we are doing ML experiments, training models, preparing [EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis), we want to share the results with the World at some point. 
One of the quickest and easiest ways to do so in python, to create a simple webapp with results, is a super-cool library [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)!
If you thought building an app in `flask` is easy, you will be amazed by streamlit simplicity.
Actually you do not have to create an ML related app, nobody checks that ;). 

If you are interested, recently, I have wrote [a blog post for Appsilon](https://appsilon.com/using-streamlit-to-deploy-poc-app-part-3/) regarding streamlit, as a continuation of our solar panels series.
Here you will find [the deployed app](https://demo.appsilon.com/apps/solar-panels-detection-streamlit).
