Some time ago, I've worked on an oil sac (energy reservoir) detection in copepods (kind of zooplankton) for UniversitÃ© Laval.
[Apart from presenting the results on the ML4Plankton conference]({{< ref ml4plankton-conference.md >}}) I've published a detailed blog post on [the Appsilon blog](https://appsilon.com/monitoring-marine-ecosystems-with-machine-learning/) that I strongly encourage you to read!
