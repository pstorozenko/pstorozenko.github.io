Recently I was working at work on detecting the oil sac in [copepods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copepod).
This is was a super cool problem in which we received data from professor [Frédéric Maps](http://www.takuvik.ulaval.ca/team/maps_frederic.php) from [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/en).
We together gave a talk on conference ML4Plankton that you can watch online!
First Frederic gives some context on why this problem is important and later I explain methods used and problems you can find.
Our talk is available online here:

In some time a post on Appsilon page will be released where I present some more results.
Stay tuned!
