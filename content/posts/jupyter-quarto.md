What if you just don't like `rmd`/`qmd` format anymore?
You love jupyter notebooks and that's your way of working (that's me).
Still, you must generate report from time to time.
Fortunately `quarto` solves this problem brilliantly!

The reports look beautifully.
Not only htmls what we might expect, but pdfs as well!

I wrote [a post for Appsilon that has been published on medium](https://medium.com/appsilon-data-science/jupyter-notebook-quarto-9e449f6336bf) regarding this topic.
Be sure to check it out, it was a real game-changer for me!
