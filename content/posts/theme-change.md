I had to switch the theme of the blog.
This was unexpected and was a hard reminder that you should always be careful with your dependencies.
You may rarely think about a theme being a dependency, but when I wanted to use the [hello-friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) theme under hugo 0.145.x, I discovered its no longer maintained (for over 3 years), the generation just failed.
There were some deprecations, but they already became errors in the hugo version I was using.

Without much thought, I switched to something that looks decent and is maintained, [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-papermod/).
I hope you like it, and that the content is still readable and enjoyable.

P.S. There's a chance, I'll come back to blogging more often, but I can't promise anything.
