I wrote [another post](https://appsilon.com/streamlit-tutorial-rstudio-connect/) for Appsilon, this time about deploying [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) applications on [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) infrastructure.

This post might be totally useless for majority of audience, but **a pure gold** for a few ðŸ’°.
What is streamlit you can understand from [my previous post](posts/solar-panels-3).

Having a running app in your browser is already cool, but how cool is it to deploy your app on the internet?
If you need an enterprise solution for hosting dashboards in RShiny/streamlit, RSConnect is the way!
In [this blog post](https://appsilon.com/streamlit-tutorial-rstudio-connect/) I focused on presenting solutions for common problems you might encounter. 

The example of [deployed app](https://demo.appsilon.com/apps/solar-panels-detection-streamlit).
