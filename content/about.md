Hi, my name is Piotr Pasza Storożenko located in Warsaw, Poland.
I'm a data scientist, physicist, by heart with love for programming.
Wannabe applied mathematician.
A huge julia enthusiast, but I code mostly in python and R.
Some small chunks of code and simulations in C++17 and newer are also fine ^^.
On this blog I share things I find interesting.
