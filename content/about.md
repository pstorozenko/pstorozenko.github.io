title: "About me"

Hi, my name is Piotr Pasza StoroÅ¼enko located in Warsaw, Poland.
I'm a machine learning engineer, physicist, by heart with love for programming.
Wannabe applied mathematician.
A huge julia enthusiast, but I code mostly in python and R.
Some small chunks of code and simulations in C++17 and newer are also fine ^^.
On this blog I share things I find interesting.

## Experience

* Fall 2023 - Now -- Innovation Lead@[Appsilon](https://appsilon.com/)

  Who's the Innovation Lead? An experienced engineer outside of regular projects who helps to make company future-ready. [Glue work](https://www.noidea.dog/glue) is my work. I'm the go-to person that connects the tech team, delivery, marketing, sales, supports the board when it comes to new technologies, architectures, and methodologies, or innovation to put it simply. In the meantime, I try to code, below are some of the projects and initiatives I am or was involved in:
  * ML Systems Development
    * Architected and deployed image classification ML system using BentoML (FastAPI + Docker) on GCP Cloud Run, implementing cost-efficient serverless infrastructure
    * Developed high-performance data visualization dashboard for ML research, handling _a lot_ of data points and contributing to a [Nature publication](https://www.appsilon.com/post/interactive-cell-analysis)
    * Evaluated and implemented [Nextflow](https://www.appsilon.com/post/nextflow-for-computational-biology-workflows) for ML workflow management, resulting in successful client adoption and multiple project extensions
  * Technical Leadership
    * [Built LLM-powered application Flow](https://www.appsilon.com/post/llm-quarto-automation), this is like customizable Claude Artifact, but for RShiny apps, Quarto reports and other applications.
    * Created an open-source [Tapyr](https://github.com/Appsilon/tapyr-template) package for Shiny for Python application bootstrapping
    * Created full-stack architecture connecting ML models with modern frontend frameworks (React, Next.js, Observable Framework)
    * The main code reviewer for python code in the company.
    * I brought the torch of knowledge to our python devs by introducing them to uv (earlier to poetry), ruff, pyright (earlier mypy), playwright, pydantic-settings, hydra, and other modern tools.
  * Strategic Innovation
    * Led technology evaluation initiatives identifying alternatives to core R Shiny business, resulting in expanded service offerings
    * Established structured innovation process balancing exploratory research with client-driven development
    * Bridged gap between technical capabilities and market needs, translating POCs into commercial engagements
* 2021 - Fall 2023 -- ML Engineer@[Appsilon](https://appsilon.com/)
  * Research in [3D animation modeling using unusual GANs - GenAI before it was cool](https://www.appsilon.com/case-studies/rigplays-journey-with-generative-ai).
    * Tech lead behind porting student-grade pytorch code to production-grade pytorch lightning with tests, typing, CI/CD, model serialization, deployment, and more.
    * Designed and implemented architecture for robust data validation
  * Research in artistic sketch to photorealistic 3D model area. Working with SoTA GANs models.
    * Explorative and innovative research that can be summarized as _Take a few (over 20) different GANs, classifiers, algorithms, and mix them into pipeline that will generate riggable head 3D models from sketches_.
    * Apart from ML engineering parts of the pipeline, I was the tech lead behind orchestrating all parts of the pipeline.
    * Everything in Pytorch, FastAPI, GCP stack.
  * [Counting Nests of Shags in Antarctic](https://www.appsilon.com/post/yolo-counting-nests-antarctic-birds) with [IBB PAS](https://ibb.edu.pl/en/laboratory/robert-bialik/)
    * YOLOv6-based model for counting nests of shags in Antarctica.
    * Co-invented and implemented a novel algorithm for counting objects from image patches. See [Inference Method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954124002498?via%3Dihub#s0045) in paper for more details.
  * Collaboration with professor [FrÃ©dÃ©ric Maps](http://www.takuvik.ulaval.ca/team/maps_frederic.php) from [UniversitÃ© Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/en) on [detecting oil sacs in copepods](https://dropsu.sorbonne-universite.fr/s/w5Lm7P4sR8rMKtB?dir=undefined&openfile=117720445) - real-world image segmentation problem.
  * Improvements in [Mbaza project](https://appsilon.com/gabon-wildlife-ai-for-biodiversity-conservation/) - production classification models for camera traps, deployed in Gabon. ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™
* 2020 - 2021 -- Data Scientist@[ING Bank ÅšlÄ…ski](https://www.ing.pl/)
  * Part of ING Poland Center of Expertise - Artificial Intelligence. Data Science consulting for various internal teams. Both problem understanding as well as delivering quick PoCs.
  * Creating Polish language NLP model for sentence multi-label classification, Corporate Clients Department. Mixing various techniques of transformers with classic ML.
  * Creating and teaching at internal _AI Academy_ - explaining basics of data processing and ML in python for over 100 people in a few 8-week courses.
  * Working on the whole company standards for machine learning.
* Summer 2019 -- Research internship [SURF@IFISC](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/), UIB, Palma de Mallorca
