Here I present some resources I found very useful when learning various stuff:

## Youtube channels

## Online courses

* [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/) - While I'm not a big fan of `fastai` in terms how it's written and how easily you can incorporate it into `pytorch` code, this course is a create place to start your journey with ML/AI if you are coder, but never learned anything about statistics and ML in details.
