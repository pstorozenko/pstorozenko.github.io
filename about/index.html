An experienced engineer outside of regular projects who helps to make company future-ready. Glue work is my work. Iâ€™m the go-to person that connects the tech team, delivery, marketing, sales, supports the board when it comes to new technologies, architectures, and methodologies, or innovation to put it simply. In the meantime, I try to code, below are some of the projects and initiatives I am or was involved in:\nML Systems Development Architected and deployed image classification ML system using BentoML (FastAPI + Docker) on GCP Cloud Run, implementing cost-efficient serverless infrastructure Developed high-performance data visualization dashboard for ML research, handling a lot of data points and contributing to a Nature publication Evaluated and implemented Nextflow for ML workflow management, resulting in successful client adoption and multiple project extensions Technical Leadership Built LLM-powered application Flow, this is like customizable Claude Artifact, but for RShiny apps, Quarto reports and other applications. Created an open-source Tapyr package for Shiny for Python application bootstrapping Created full-stack architecture connecting ML models with modern frontend frameworks (React, Next.js, Observable Framework) The main code reviewer for python code in the company. I brought the torch of knowledge to our python devs by introducing them to uv (earlier to poetry), ruff, pyright (earlier mypy), playwright, pydantic-settings, hydra, and other modern tools. Strategic Innovation Led technology evaluation initiatives identifying alternatives to core R Shiny business, resulting in expanded service offerings Established structured innovation process balancing exploratory research with client-driven development Bridged gap between technical capabilities and market needs, translating POCs into commercial engagements 2021 - Fall 2023 â€“ ML Engineer@Appsilon\nResearch in 3D animation modeling using unusual GANs - GenAI before it was cool. Tech lead behind porting student-grade pytorch code to production-grade pytorch lightning with tests, typing, CI/CD, model serialization, deployment, and more. Designed and implemented architecture for robust data validation Research in artistic sketch to photorealistic 3D model area. Working with SoTA GANs models. Explorative and innovative research that can be summarized as Take a few (over 20) different GANs, classifiers, algorithms, and mix them into pipeline that will generate riggable head 3D models from sketches. Apart from ML engineering parts of the pipeline, I was the tech lead behind orchestrating all parts of the pipeline. Everything in Pytorch, FastAPI, GCP stack. Counting Nests of Shags in Antarctic with IBB PAS YOLOv6-based model for counting nests of shags in Antarctica. Co-invented and implemented a novel algorithm for counting objects from image patches.
