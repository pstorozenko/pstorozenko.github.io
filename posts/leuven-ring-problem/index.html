There is one interesting mathematical problem from those times I&rsquo;d like to share.
This Belgian city has a topology of a big circle with a city inside.</p><iframe width=100% height=600px frameborder=0 src="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/leuven_652789?scaleControl=true&miniMap=false&scrollWheelZoom=true&zoomControl=true&allowEdit=false&moreControl=true&searchControl=true&tilelayersControl=null&embedControl=null&datalayersControl=true&onLoadPanel=none&captionBar=true//"></iframe><p>One early, cold, damp, and windy morning (as it is in Belgium) when I was coming back from some trip I had to go from the railway station (right side of the ring) to my dormitory (bottom of the ring).
As shown on the map, the distance was 1/3 circumference of the Leuven ring.
The question I asked myself is whether or not I should cross the street.</p><ol><li>If you cross the road and walk on the inner side of Tiensevest street (the yellow ring street) you are walking around a smaller circle.</li><li>If you don&rsquo;t cross the street, you walk around a bigger circle but save energy on crossing the road.</li></ol><h2 id=ring-calculations>Ring calculations</h2><p>The Tiensevest is a pretty wide street, roughly $d = 30$m.
The inner ring radius is approximately $r_1 = 1\ 000$m.
So the outer ring has radius $r_2 = r_1 + d = 1\ 030$m.
Circumference of a circle is $c = 2\pi r$.</p><ol><li>The first path is $p_1 = (2\pi r_1) / 3 + 2 d$ since we have to pass the street twice.</li><li>The second path is $p_2 = (2\pi r_2) / 3 = (2\pi (r_1 + d)) / 3$.</li></ol><p>If we approximate $\pi \approx 3$ as I did during that morning we found out that:
$$
p_1 = (2\pi r_1) / 3 + 2 d = 2r_1 + 2d = 2 (r_1 + d),
$$
$$
p_2 = (2\pi (r_1 + d)) / 3 = 2 (r_1 + d).
$$
So $p_1 = p_2$!!!
This means the distance we saved by walking around a smaller circle is lost on crossing the street.</p><h2 id=when-should-i-cross-the-street>When should I cross the street?</h2><p>The previous calculations were <em>back-of-the-envelope calculations</em> made without any envelope.
Instead of fixing the fraction of circle traveled on 1/3 let&rsquo;s consider any fraction.</p><h3 id=on-describing-fraction-of-circle>On describing fraction of circle</h3><p>A small inclusion on fractions of a circle.
There are few methods that we use to describe the fraction of a circle.</p><ol><li>The simplest is probably just fraction $p \in [0, 1]$ of the whole circumference.</li><li>Another natural description is to describe fraction in terms of angle from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$ in degrees.</li><li>Finally, the least intuitive (at first) method is to describe fraction as angle from $0$ to $2\pi$ radians.</li></ol><p>As we will see here, the last method might be the simplest in right case!</p><h3 id=back-to-the-rings>Back to the rings</h3><p>Since the whole circle circumference is $2\pi r$, the fraction of angle $\varphi$ in radians is just $l = \varphi r$.
So:
$$
p_1 = \varphi r_1 + 2d,
$$
$$
p_2 = \varphi r_2 = \varphi (r_1 + d).
$$
The difference between paths is:
$$
p_2 - p_1 = \varphi (r_1 + d) - (\varphi r_1 + 2d) = \varphi r_1 + \varphi d - \varphi r_1 - 2d = \varphi d - 2d = (\varphi - 2) d.
$$
This value represents gain when crossing the street compared to sticking to the outer circle.
Crossing to the inner circle is worth only when you travel at least 2 radians so $2 / 2\pi = 1/ \pi \approx 0.32$ of the whole circumference.
What is worth mentioning is that it doesn&rsquo;t depend on the sizes of circles and margin $d$.</p><p>So what is the cost of crossing/not crossing the street?
It may be hard to calculate $1/\pi$ in your head but you will miss the optimal travel distance by $\pm d$ in angles $\varphi \in [1, 3]$ rad or $\alpha \in [57 ^\circ , 172^\circ]$, reasonably wide margin.
Probably gain is too small to compensate for time spent on waiting for lights to change.</p><p>Another thing I&rsquo;d like to point out is that we encountered 2 radians here.
Not $\pi/3$ or $\pi/6$ radians.
Just 2 radians.
It&rsquo;s uncommon but it happens to meet values in radians that are not a rational fractions of $2\pi$.
When you cover the angle of 2 radians, you travel exactly the distance of 2 radiuses around a circle (that&rsquo;s from the definition).</p><h2 id=strange-linearity-of-circle-circumference>Strange linearity of circle circumference</h2><p>Another fact I&rsquo;d like to mention is what happens when you go all the way around the outer circle.
Distance traveled is
$$
2 \pi r_2 = 2 \pi (r_1 + d) = 2\pi r_1 + 2\pi d.
$$
We can split this value into two parts.
One reflects the circumference of a circle with radius $r_1$ and the other with radius $d$.
So effectively going around the outer circle is equivalent to <strong>independently</strong> going around two circles.
An inner circle and a circle with radius $d = r_2 - r_1$.
Isn&rsquo;t it strange in some way?</p><h2 id=a-related-classic-physics-exercise-from-highschool>A related classic physics exercise from highschool</h2><blockquote><p>There is a rope along the Moon&rsquo;s equator. How much should you lengthen the rope to be able to pass underneath it at any point without touching the rope? You need 30cm. Assume the Moon is a perfect sphere suspended in a vacuum with a radius of 1 737.4 km.</p></blockquote><p>The situation looks almost the same as in Leuven with inner circle $r_1 = 1\ 737\ 400$m and $d = 0.3 m$.
The initial rope length is $2\pi r_1$.
Required rope length is $2\pi (r_1 + d)$.
Difference in lengths is $2\pi (r_1 + d) - 2\pi r_1 = 2\pi d$.
So you have to lengthen the rope by just $2\pi d \approx 2.88$m.
Compared to the original rope length $2\pi r_1 \approx 10\ 916\ 406.15$m it&rsquo;s nothing&mldr;
The result is as strange as it was 10+ years ago.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the line is around the Moon, the Earth, the Milky Way, or around some small tree/pole&mldr;</p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>Probably it&rsquo;s not worth crossing the street on the other side when going around the circle as in the Leuven scenario.
Some physics exercises answers will be strange for your whole life.</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/speed-of-traversing-matrix/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
