Having a running app in your browser is already cool, but how cool is it to deploy your app on the internet?

Usually when we are doing ML experiments, training models, preparing EDA, we want to share the results with the World at some point. One of the quickest and easiest ways to do so in python, to create a simple webapp with results, is a super-cool library streamlit! If you thought building an app in flask is easy, you will be amazed by streamlit simplicity.

Why it differs whetter matrix is traversed by rows or columns? Even though we think of a matrices as a two dimensional creatures, inside a computer they have to be stored as a sequence of numbers. Therefore there are two schemas one can follow, row-first and column-first.
