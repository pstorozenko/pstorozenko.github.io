&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sfinks.fizyka.pw.edu.pl/">SFINKS&lt;/a> is a small conference on complex systems and interdisciplinary physics.
I wanted to present something there since the first edition in 2016, but I never stood a chance.
Every year there was something up, like an international exchange or a lot of tough exams.
Finally, this year I was able to fullfil my dream as I presented a lightning talk &lt;em>O strachu przed liczeniem na papierze&lt;/em> (eng. &lt;em>About the fear of calculating on paper&lt;/em>).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DaftAcademy Course Finished 🐍🏁</title><link>/posts/daftacademy-finished/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 23:44:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/daftacademy-finished/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to inform that the course has finished and the total of 56 people received a graduation certificate (which required passing homeworks for over 70%), congratulations! 🎉
It was a great experience and I&amp;rsquo;m happy that I was able to teach so many young students!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PyTorch-Lightning + Hydra to Boost Your PyTorch ⚡🐉</title><link>/posts/pytorch-hydra/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 00:38:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/pytorch-hydra/</guid><description>
When working with deep learning problems I usually use PyTorch. I like this framework as it gives me a lot of freedom and allows to write code in the pythonic way. Using bare pytorch unfortunately often means writing a lot of boilerplate code, which no-one like. Another problem that arises during longer and larger projects is experiments running and configuration maintenance. I tackle those two problems by using pytorch-lightning and Hydra.</description></item><item><title>DaftAcademy Announcement 🐍👨‍🏫</title><link>/posts/daftacademy-announcement/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2022 23:32:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/daftacademy-announcement/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ll create and teach the course &lt;a href="https://www.daftacademy.pl/python-levelup-data-sciene-by-appsilon">&lt;em>Python LevelUP: Data Science by Appsilon&lt;/em>&lt;/a> in collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.daftacademy.pl/">DaftAcademy&lt;/a>, part of &lt;a href="https://daftcode.pl/">DaftCode&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will be a five-week course on the basics of Data Science in python.
&lt;strong>The course materials will be available on GitHub for free&lt;/strong>.
Apart from teaching the classic stuff, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to show some of the newest and coolest libraries out there.
Even if you already know most of this stuff, I really recommend to take a closer look on the unknown packages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Copepods Oil Sac 🌊🛢👜</title><link>/posts/copepods-blogpost/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 16:25:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/copepods-blogpost/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Some time ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on an oil sac (energy reservoir) detection in copepods (kind of zooplankton) for Université Laval.
&lt;a href="/posts/ml4plankton-conference/">Apart from presenting the results on the ML4Plankton conference&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ve published a detailed blog post on &lt;a href="https://appsilon.com/monitoring-marine-ecosystems-with-machine-learning/">the Appsilon blog&lt;/a> that I strongly encourage you to read!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Presentation at ML4Plankton Conference 🌊🐟</title><link>/posts/ml4plankton-conference/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 09:50:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/ml4plankton-conference/</guid><description>
Recently I was working at work on detecting the oil sac in copepods. This is was a super cool problem in which we received data from professor Frédéric Maps from Université Laval. We together gave a talk on conference ML4Plankton that you can watch online! First Frederic gives some context on why this problem is important and later I explain methods used and problems you can find. Our talk is available online here:</description></item><item><title>StyleGANv2 in Your Hands 💇👻</title><link>/posts/stylegan-in-your-hands/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 22:30:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/stylegan-in-your-hands/</guid><description>
This is the second post from micro-series preceding the SFI conference. In the first post I showed how easy it is to do the style transfer at home. Now, I would like to present you how to play with StyleGANv2. StyleGANv2 is the second version of StyleGAN, they are very similar in core principals. We will be working with StyleGANv2 but I will refer to it as SG. There is a lot that can be said/explained about SG.</description></item><item><title>Streamlit Tutorial: How to Deploy Streamlit Apps on RStudio Connect 💰</title><link>/posts/solar-panels-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 20:23:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/solar-panels-4/</guid><description>
I wrote another post for Appsilon, this time about deploying streamlit applications on RStudio Connect infrastructure.
This post might be totally useless for majority of audience, but a pure gold for a few 💰. What is streamlit you can understand from my previous post.
Having a running app in your browser is already cool, but how cool is it to deploy your app on the internet? If you need an enterprise solution for hosting dashboards in RShiny/streamlit, RSConnect is the way!</description></item><item><title>Playing With Style Transfer 🎨</title><link>/posts/playing-with-style-transfer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 21:12:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/playing-with-style-transfer/</guid><description>
As mentioned earlier, I will be giving a talk on the 17th SFI IT Academic Festival on the topic of style transfer and StyleGAN. In this post I would like to show you how easy it is to play with style transfer on your own!

I am happy to share that I was invited (for the first time in my life!) to give a talk on a conference. 🎉 It will be the 17th SFI IT Academic Festival, organized by students from the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. The conference will be held on 14-16 of March 2022.
My lecture will be in Polish on topic StyleGAN w Twoich rękach -&amp;gt; StyleGAN in Your Hands, I will talk about transfer learning in general and later about StyleGANv2.</description></item><item><title>Detecting Solar Panels from satellite images part 3 - PoC model deployment in streamlit 🎈</title><link>/posts/solar-panels-3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 20:23:36 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/solar-panels-3/</guid><description>
This one is short. :)
Usually when we are doing ML experiments, training models, preparing EDA, we want to share the results with the World at some point. One of the quickest and easiest ways to do so in python, to create a simple webapp with results, is a super-cool library streamlit! If you thought building an app in flask is easy, you will be amazed by streamlit simplicity. Actually you do not have to create an ML related app, nobody checks that ;).</description></item><item><title>Minimizing The Sum of Absolute Values -- Day 7 Advent of Code part 1 🎄</title><link>/posts/aoc2021-minimizing-loss/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 21:00:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/aoc2021-minimizing-loss/</guid><description>
This year I took part in the advent of code event. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard about it, I attach tl;dr bellow. Today, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my solution for Day 7 problem, because I find it very interesting.

Today I have a short one, a follow-up to the post on pizza sizes. Recently, I was in my local pizza place where I had to choose between 32 and 46cm pizza. The bigger one cost 5 PLN more. Even without looking at my table, I chose the bigger one. I knew, however, that I&amp;rsquo;m going to eat only half of my pizza so I asked to pack the remaining half.</description></item><item><title>Practical Mathematical Optimization 🏡🛒🧃</title><link>/posts/practical-mathematical-optimization/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 14:18:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/practical-mathematical-optimization/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="/posts/mathematical-optimization/">the previous post&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ve presented the basics of stating mathematical optimization problems and JuMP framework in julia.

Pizzas packed in pizza However, I would not like to assume that everyone is familiar with the optimization theory (you may graduate from Computer Science and still not know a lot) so I want to present an introduction here as high school math and quadratic equations are enough to understand those concepts.</description></item><item><title>Detecting Solar Panels from satellite images part 1 -- data preparation🛰️</title><link>/posts/solar-panels-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 11:18:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/solar-panels-1/</guid><description>

Recently I wrote a post about DVC at my company&amp;rsquo;s, Appsilon blog. DVC is like a git, but for data, models and experiments. It also allows for creating an automated experiments pipelines.
As a teaser I&amp;rsquo;ll just say that, having prepared scripts for model training and evaluating, when new data is added to the repo, the whole training is run automatically. Metrics are saved to appropriate files alongside with parameters, same with plots.</description></item><item><title>Speed of Traversing Matrix → vs ↓</title><link>/posts/speed-of-traversing-matrix/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 22:24:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/speed-of-traversing-matrix/</guid><description>
Today I would like to mention a low-level peculiarity I was taught in highschool, but passed over during my studies.
Why it differs whetter matrix is traversed by rows or columns? # Even though we think of a matrices as a two dimensional creatures, inside a computer they have to be stored as a sequence of numbers. Therefore there are two schemas one can follow, row-first and column-first. Historically they are called C-style and Fortran-style respectively.</description></item><item><title>The Leuven Ring Problem ○</title><link>/posts/leuven-ring-problem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 01:33:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/leuven-ring-problem/</guid><description>
During my studies, I spent one semester at KU Leuven. There is one interesting mathematical problem from those times I&amp;rsquo;d like to share. This Belgian city has a topology of a big circle with a city inside.

One morning I was standing in a queue in my local bakery, and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a woman buying one of those small quasi-pizzas. Pizzas ~20cm in diameter. Immediately I thought about how profitable it is when compared to the full-size 42cm pizza. Since the area of a larger pizza is 4 times bigger, of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not worth buying smaller pizzas.
Then I thought about fitting smaller pizzas inside the bigger one.</description></item><item><title>Comparing fractions of fractions on COVID case 😷</title><link>/posts/comparing-fractions-of-fractions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:38:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/comparing-fractions-of-fractions/</guid><description>
I had a little argue recently with one anti-vaxxer and I thought it will make an interesting blog content. I tried to convince them that vaccinating is good because people are at least not dieing and what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard was:

Hello, my name is Pasza /ˈpaʃa/ and I welcome you to my blog. My plan is to share with you many insights I find on interesting topics. Some will be probably understandable for primary school kids and some will require university level math. This is however my blog and I can do what I want ^^.
You can find more about me in related pages. As for now you can check out useful materials.</description></item></channel></rss>
