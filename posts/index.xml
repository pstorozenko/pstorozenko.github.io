I had a little argue with one anti-vaxxer recently and I thought it will make an interesting blog content. I tried to convince them that vaccinating is good because people are at least not dieing and what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard was:
Ohh, vaccines are not helping at all. A friend of mine is working at the hospital at says that 50% of covid patients were already vaccinated.
I decided not to argue with this number, but rather give it a try.</description></item><item><title>My First Post!</title><link>/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 23:51:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>
Hello, my name is Pasza /ˈpɑʃɑ/ and I welcome you to my blog. My plan is to share with you all insights I find on interesting topics. Some will be probably understandable for primary school kids and some will require university level math. This is however my blog and I can do what I want ^^.
You can find more about me in related pages. As for now you can check out useful materials.</description></item></channel></rss>
