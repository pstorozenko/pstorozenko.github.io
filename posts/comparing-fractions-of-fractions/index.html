I tried to convince them that vaccinating is good because people are at least not dieing and what I&rsquo;ve heard was:</p><blockquote><p>Ohh, vaccines are not helping at all. A friend of mine is working at the hospital at says that <strong>50%</strong> of covid patients were already vaccinated.</p></blockquote><p>I decided not to argue nor check the data source, but rather <em>give it a try</em>.
What is important, it took place in the UK where over <strong>70%</strong> of population received at least one dose of vaccine.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say that we have a population of $1\ 000\ 000$, from which $700\ 000$ is vaccinated and $300\ 000$ is not.
Now suppose that out of this million, $1\ 000$ people ended up in hospital, $500$ vaccinated and $500$ not.
So the probability of ending up in hospital while being vaccinated is $p_v = \frac{500}{700\ 000} = \frac{5}{7\ 000}$ and probability of ending up in the hospital while not being vaccinated is $p_{nv}= \frac{500}{300\ 000} = \frac{5}{3\ 000}$.
We can see that the second probability is $\frac{p_{nv}}{p_{v}} = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.334$ over twice as big!</p><p>This clearly shows the positive effect of vaccines even though <em>half of people taken to the hospital has been vaccinated</em>.
To <em>proof</em> vaccines being non-effective 70% of people taken to the hospital because of covid should be vaccinated.
This might be confusing at first, but makes since after you think for a while.</p><p>Calculating above probabilities and understanding the underlying phenomena is closely related to the Bayes&rsquo; theorem.
