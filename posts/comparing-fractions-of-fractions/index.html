I tried to convince them that vaccinating is good because people are at least not dieing and what Iâ€™ve heard was:\nOhh, vaccines are not helping at all. A friend of mine is working at the hospital at says that 50% of covid patients were already vaccinated.\nI decided not to argue nor check the data source, but rather give it a try. What is important, it took place in the UK where over 70% of population received at least one dose of vaccine.\nLetâ€™s say that we have a population of $1\\ 000\\ 000$, from which $700\\ 000$ is vaccinated and $300\\ 000$ is not. Now suppose that out of this million, $1\\ 000$ people ended up in hospital, $500$ vaccinated and $500$ not. So the probability of ending up in hospital while being vaccinated is $p_v = \\frac{500}{700\\ 000} = \\frac{5}{7\\ 000}$ and probability of ending up in the hospital while not being vaccinated is $p_{nv}= \\frac{500}{300\\ 000} = \\frac{5}{3\\ 000}$. We can see that the second probability is $\\frac{p_{nv}}{p_{v}} = \\frac{7}{3} \\approx 2.334$ over twice as big!\nThis clearly shows the positive effect of vaccines even though half of people taken to the hospital has been vaccinated. To proof vaccines being non-effective 70% of people taken to the hospital because of covid should be vaccinated. This might be confusing at first, but makes since after you think for a while.\nCalculating above probabilities and understanding the underlying phenomena is closely related to the Bayesâ€™ theorem.
