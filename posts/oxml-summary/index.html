It‚Äôs much more important and impactful to help thousands of poor people than just a few rich people. Everyone should think about it when planning their efforts. Researchers don‚Äôt like to train GANs. Despite all the efforts, they‚Äôre very tricky to train. However, it‚Äôs nice to play with an already-trained GAN. Explainability is not that much important to medical experts. Often it‚Äôs more important for them to know the uncertainty than the explainability. ML models are often just a suggestion that something should be explored in more detail, kind of biomarkers. There‚Äôs a huge hype around multimodality nowadays. Multimodality - creating an ML system that works on, e.g., text and images at the same time. It may also mean working on different kinds of images, e.g. MRI and CT scans of the brain. Or even combining CTs of different parts of the body. A lot of problems revolve around VAE/diffusion networks. Generation of fake signals for other methods. Bringing different modalities together. A/B tests are usually not possible in medicine. The holy grail (one of very many it seems üôà) is personalized recommendations per patient with all the restrictions regarding data privacy taken into account. We‚Äôre far from getting a diagnosis from ML. Most research focuses on providing knowledge discovery and assisting doctors. What do attendees to OxML do for a living I was curious about what other people do. Here is the list of problems people tackle at work/during Ph.D. studies.\n3D reconstruction of colony imagery - NERF-like problem Predicting the outcomes of surgery before it happens - maybe the patient is in a high-risk group and we don‚Äôt know it Estimating transition matrices for diseases per patient in the hospital - maybe some patients have to be isolated from other individuals in particular Gene expression data generation Brain EEG signals for modifying StyleGAN latent space - we can change people‚Äôs skin color with our thoughts Predicting the trajectory of patients - given the history, what will be the diseases the patient will have?
