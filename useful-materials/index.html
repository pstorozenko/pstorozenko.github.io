Here I pay my small tribute to some of my favorite scientific videos creators.</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw>3blue1brown</a> - a BRILLIANT channel, the best math channel ever. So many interesting topics explained so nicely with such nice visualizations. Topics range from fundamentals of calculus to perfect visualizations of Fourier transforms.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile>computerphile</a> - a great channel with various topics from programming world. Very nice material on ideas behind machine learning and cryptography.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg>Mathologer</a> - kind of longer videos on interesting mathematical topics.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6jM0RFkr4eSkzT5Gx0HOAw>Michael Penn</a> - Higher math explained in a very clear and concise way.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/minuteearth>MinuteEarth</a> - short videos about nature.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics>minutephysics</a> - short videos about physics.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile>Numberphile</a> - very rich and old channel with lots of materials on various aspects of mathematics.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/periodicvideos>Periodic Videos</a> - FANTASTIC channel about chemistry. I was always interested in chemistry (even had some achievements in chemical contest in secondary schools). This channel features lovely chemistry professor that explains different stuff and his coworkers that conduct experiments. I definitely recommend this channel for everyone!!!</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/gradyhillhouse>Practical Engineering</a> - solid channel, mainly on civil engineering. It covers a lot of non trivial effects. What I like here are experiments conducted in garage.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1IuLEqb6UEA_zQ81kwXfg>Real Engineering</a> - A very nice</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3TAqUdZld-6B76GqrFEV8g>RS Elektronika</a> - The only Polish channel I put on this list. It helped me to pass a few exams during my studies, I&rsquo;m so grateful :). It covers a lot of electronic related topics, from the very basics like resistance, voltage, current, though RLC circuits, up to power supplies and various communication standards.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/destinws2>SmarterEveryDay</a> - just perfect channel focusing on interesting stuff. Just like that.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths>Stand-up Maths</a> - A math channel that tries to make math fun and succeeds :D I really Matt Parker, expect a blog post on one of his books.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/steventhebrave>Steve Mould</a> - Kind of companion channel to the above one. This focuses on physics on the other hand. Really valuable content, definitely check it out.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/enyay>Tom Scott</a> - A veteran of science related content. Now he creates interesting videos on interesting topics. His insight and thoughts are very, very valuable for me. A wise man.</li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpCSAcbqs-sjEVfk_hMfY9w>Zach Star</a> - Nice channel with both funny short videos for eating breakfast as well as detailed analysis of complex topics. Check it out ;)</li></ul><h2 id=online-courses>Online courses</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppWPuXsnf1Q&list=PLZHQObOWTQDP5CVelJJ1bNDouqrAhVPev">High school math</a> - I really liked this miniseries. Even though I knew and understood quadratic equation very deeply, Grant was able to teach me something new, magnificent. I recommend it to everyone, especially high school students.</li><li><a href=https://course.fast.ai/>fastai</a> - While I&rsquo;m not a big fan of <code>fastai</code> in terms how it&rsquo;s written and how easily you can incorporate it into <code>pytorch</code> code, this course is a create place to start your journey with ML/AI if you are coder, but never learned anything about statistics and ML in details.</li><li><a href=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-04-quantum-physics-i-spring-2016/>Quantum Physics I</a> - if you want to learn the basics of quantum physics, that&rsquo;s the way to go!</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Linear algebra</a> - here you will understand why is linear algebra so useful and why it&rsquo;s crucial to have a deeper understanding of this topic. How to work with algebra you will learn from <a href=https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra>Khan Academy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">Calculus</a>- here you will understand why is calculus so useful and why it&rsquo;s crucial to have a deeper understanding of this topic. How to work with calculus you will learn from <a href=https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1>Khan Academy</a></li><li>Khan academy mentioned above. This a brilliant resource. I feel like they changed the world with this initiative.</li></ul></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user">Piotr Pasza StoroÅ¼enko</div></div></footer><script src=/assets/main.js></script>
